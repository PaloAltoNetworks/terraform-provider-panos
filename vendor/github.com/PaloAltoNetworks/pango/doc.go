/*
Package pango is a golang cross version mechanism for interacting with Palo Alto
Networks devices (including physical and virtualized Next-generation Firewalls
and Panorama).  Versioning support is in place for PAN-OS 6.1 to 8.1.

To start, create a client connection with the desired parameters and then
initialize the connection:

    package main
    
    import (
        "log"
        "github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango"
    )
    
    func main() {
        var err error
        c := pango.Firewall{Client: pango.Client{
            Hostname: "127.0.0.1",
            Username: "admin",
            Password: "admin",
            Logging: pango.LogAction | pango.LogOp,
        }}
        if err = c.Initialize(); err != nil {
            log.Printf("Failed to initialize client: %s", err)
            return
        }
        log.Printf("Initialize ok")
    }

Initializing the connection creates the API key (if it was not already
specified), then performs "show system info" to get the PAN-OS version.  Once
the firewall client is created, you can query and configure the Palo
Alto Networks device from the functions inside the various namespaces of the
client connection.  Namespaces correspond to the various configuration areas
available in the GUI.  For example:

    err = c.Network.EthernetInterface.Set(...)
    myPolicies, err := c.Policies.Security.GetList(...)

Generally speaking, there are the following functions inside each namespace:

    * GetList
    * ShowList
    * Get
    * Show
    * Set
    * Edit
    * Delete

These functions correspond with PAN-OS Get, Show, Set, Edit, and
Delete API calls.  Get(), Set(), and Edit() take and return normalized,
version independent objects.  These version safe objects are typically named
Entry, which corresponds to how the object is placed in the PAN-OS XPATH.

Some Entry objects have a special function, Defaults().  Invoking this
function will initialize the object with some default values.  Each Entry
that implements Defaults() calls out in its documentation what parameters
are affected by this, and what the defaults are.

For any version safe object, attempting to configure a parameter that your
PAN-OS doesn't support will be safely ignored in the resultant XML sent to the
firewall / Panorama.

Using Edit Functions

The PAN-OS XML API Edit command can be used to both create as well as update
existing config, however it can also truncate config for the given XPATH.  Due
to this, if you want to use Edit(), you need to make sure that you perform
either a Get() or a Show() first, make your modification, then invoke
Edit() using that object.  If you don't do this, you will truncate any sub
config.

API documentation.
