# Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Provider

PAN-OS&reg; is the operating system for Palo Alto Networks&reg; NGFWs and Panorama&trade;. The panos provider allows you to manage various aspects of a firewall's or a Panorama's config, such as data interfaces and security policies.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available Panorama and NGFW resources.

~> **NOTE:** The provider requires the use of Terraform 1.8 or later.

-> **NOTE:** The panos provider resources and data sources are auto-generated based on [specs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-codegen/tree/main/specs) using [pan-os-codegen(https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-codegen/tree/main)

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    panos = {
      source = "PaloAltoNetworks/panos"
      version = "2.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the PANOS Provider
provider "panos" {
  hostname = "hostname"
  username = "username"
  password = "password"
}

```

## Authentication

The following authentication methods are supported. From highest to lowest priority;

- Static credentials via provider block
- Environment variables
- Configuration file

### Static Credentials

!> **Warning:** Including hard-coded credentials in Terraform configurations is discouraged due to the risk of secret leakage.

Static credentials can be provided through either username-password combinations or API key-based authentication.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "panos" {
  hostname = "hostname"
  username = "username"
  password = "password"
}

# API key based authentication
provider "panos" {
  hostname = "hostname"
  api_key  = "api_key"
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can provide your credentials using the `PANOS_USERNAME` and `PANOS_PASSWORD` environment variables for username-password based authentication, or use `PANOS_API_KEY` for API key based authentication, along with `PANOS_HOSTNAME`.

```terraform
provider "panos" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export PANOS_HOSTNAME="1.2.3.4"
$ export PANOS_USERNAME="username"
$ export PANOS_PASSWORD="password"
$ terraform plan
```

### Configuration Files

You can also supply configuration parameters for the provider using a JSON configuration file.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "panos" {
  auth_file = "/path/to/auth_file.json"
}
```


```json
{
  "hostname": "1.2.3.4",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
}
```

```json
{
  "hostname": "1.2.3.4",
  "api_key": "api_key"
}
```
